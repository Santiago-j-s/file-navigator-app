![made-with-next-14](https://github.com/Santiago-j-s/file-navigator-app/assets/4043417/cb7cad5e-85a8-4900-9e6b-1ce610f79c05)

A little app I made to play a bit with server components

It's a file navigator that allows you to navigate through your files and folders, and see the content of the files.

It supports [text, images, videos and pdf](https://github.com/Santiago-j-s/file-navigator-app/blob/main/src/app/fs/openAs.tsx), for now it's read-only, but write support is planned

I tested it on Linux and Mac, but it should work on Windows too

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santiago-j-s/file-navigator-app
